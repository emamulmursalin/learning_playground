    "It is a statistical way to test the correctness of a hypothesis (\"educated guess\") using mathematical equations & tools. As example, let's say we have a dataset with 10 variables. If we \"guess\" by seeing some plots or distribution that there are two variables which are much correlated, then this guess is called Hypothesis. Statistical checking procedures of the validity of this hypothesis are called Hypothesis Testing. \"t-test\", \"ANOVA\", \"chi-squared\", \"correlation\" these are some of the hypothesis testing techniques."
